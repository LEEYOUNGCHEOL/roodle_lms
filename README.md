_**[Marcos Ricardo][mr]**_ have had the original idea in mid 2008 when RubyLearning fully moves from mailing list to an LMS on their site.
The idea was to create a simplified version of an LMS in Rails.

And now, sometime near 2010 Christmas they decide to start get things done, not alone of course, so, here is the current and former contributor list:
